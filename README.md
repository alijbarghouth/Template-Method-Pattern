# Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This pattern promotes code reuse and allows for easy modification of individual steps in the algorithm without affecting the entire process.

## How it works
The Template Method Pattern consists of the following components:

- AbstractClass: This is the superclass that defines the template method, which is the main algorithm. 

- ConcreteClass: These are the subclasses that inherit from the AbstractClass and implement the abstract methods or hooks defined by the superclass. 

The template method follows a fixed sequence of steps, which may include some abstract steps that are meant to be overridden by the subclasses. By using this pattern, the overall algorithm's structure remains unchanged, while allowing flexibility for customizing certain steps. 

## Benefits and Use Cases
The Template Method Pattern offers several benefits:

- Code reuse: The template method provides a reusable skeleton for algorithms, allowing subclasses to implement specific steps while inheriting the common behavior from the superclass.

- Flexibility: Subclasses can override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure, providing flexibility for customization.

- Encapsulation: The algorithm's steps are encapsulated within the template method, making it easier to manage and modify individual steps independently.

The Template Method Pattern is commonly used in scenarios where there is a common algorithmic structure that needs to be followed, but with some variations in certain steps. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple classes share similar behavior but differ in specific implementations.
